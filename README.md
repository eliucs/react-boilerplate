# React Boilerplate

This is boilerplate for React projects for personal convenience, that uses:

- `yarn` for package management
- `webpack`, `live-server` to compile JavaScript assets, run dev server
- `babel` to compile JSX, ES6 code, build sourcemap
- `sass` for styling
- `react`, `react-dom` for basic React functionality for client side web apps
